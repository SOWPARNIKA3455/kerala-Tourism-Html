                <p>Locals in the capital city of Thiruvananthapuram will declare that a weekend drive to Ponmudi is among the best ways to spend time in the city. Families and friends alike are known to go on long
                    drives up the winding paths for a view they insist rivals any other in the State. The slopes shrouded in mist fill one with a feeling of wonder and amazement. A large amount of rare flora and
                    fauna can be seen here including mountain flowers, wild orchids and exotic butterflies.The temperature is equable throughout the year and the three-hour drive from the city is justified
                    once the valley comes into view. One can always stop over at the breathtaking Kallar River on the way, which flows parallel to the road in the opposite direction, with the picturesque Meenmutty
                    Waterfalls only a little distance ahead. A large number of cottages and resorts have come up in the area. The tree house view tower is another great place to visit. Ponmudi is indeed a rising hotbed
                    of tourist activity. A hill so close to the city, yet nestled so near the protective arms of the sea.Ponmudi offers beautiful trekking trails to many other wonders of nature hidden away from the
                    casualeyes. All day you can walk through the promising trails with greater excitement. Trekking to Varayadumotta, the most popular trekking trail in Ponmudi, offers a panoramic view of the hills
                    along with the Nilgiri Tahrs. Considered one of the toughest in Trivandrum, it is 18-km trek (oneside). Prior booking is needed to avail this package. Two guides will accompany the trekkers</p>

                </figure>
                <p>The world’s largest bird sculpture and within it a rock theme park for adventure enthusiasts is what today pays tribute to the mythical bird from the Indian epic Ramayana – Jatayu.Legend has it that
                    Jatayu tried to save Sita (wife of Lord Rama) when Ravana, a demon king, was abducting her in his airborne chariot. Jatayu is said to have fought valiantly and fallen on these
                    rocks, grievously injured.The Jatayu Adventure Center (Jatayu Earth's Center), at Chadayamangalam,50 km from Thiruvananthapuram, is a unique combination of artistry, mythology, technology, culture,
                    adventure,leisure, and wellness. The virtual reality museum and the theatrical magic that renders the story of Jatayu add to the magic of the destination.A creation of Mr. Rajiv Anchal, this destination is sure
                    to leave each visitor awestruck. The state of the art ropeway offers one a bird’s eye view of God’s Own Country just as the helicopter rides do as well.The Jatayu Adventure Center offers the largest
                    adventure park within a natural terrain.Paintball,valley crossing, bouldering, zip line, trekking, archery, rappelling, jumaring and
                    wall climbing are among the myriad activities available here. The climbing activities are designed around the natural rock formations on the hillside. While you are relishing the adrenaline rush the park offers you
                    make sure you explore the multi cuisines at the food court with a panoramic view and the age-old Siddha Cave Healing Center as well for a complete, wholesome experience.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>Referred to as the Venice of the East, Alappuzha has always enjoyed an important place in the maritime history of Kerala. Today, it is famous for its boat races, backwater holidays, beaches,
                    marine products and coir industry. Alappuzha Beach is a popular picnic spot. The pier, which extends out to the sea here, is over 137 years old. Entertainment facilities at the Vijaya Beach Park add to
                    the attraction of the beach. There is also an old lighthouse nearby which greatly intrigues all visitors.Another delightful experience while in Alappuzha is the houseboat cruise. The houseboats
                    you find inthe backwaters of Alappuzha are in fact a reworked version of the Kettuvallams of olden times.Kettuvallam is a Malayalam word, ‘Kettu’, refers to dwelling structures and ‘Vallom’ means
                    boat. In the olden days, kettuvallam or boat with thatched roof that covers over wooden hulls was used to carry tons of rice and spices.Of late, houseboats come equipped with all the comforts of a good
                    hotel room including furnished bedrooms, modern toilets, cozy living rooms, a kitchen and even a balcony for angling.An uninterrupted view of life in the backwaters can be enjoyed while staying in
                    a houseboat.</p>

                    sight of the water crashing onto the ground leaves you with a sense of wonder at the sheer power and magnificence of nature. Located around 63 km from Thrissur district, it is a perennial picnic spot
                    for people in the area and beyond. Its surrounding greenery is perfect for walks and picnics with loved ones. Lying at the entrance to the Sholayar forest ranges, it is a part of the Chalakudy River
                    which calls the Western Ghats its home.Barely 5 km away is another family favourite, VazhachalWaterfalls.These waterfalls became famous for not just their view but the endemic species found in
                    the surrounding dense forests. Researcher have found four endangered species of the Hornbill here,the only place they thrive in the entire Western Ghats. Ornithologists attach great significance to this
                    location and bird watchers can come across many rare and vibrant species in these parts.</p>
